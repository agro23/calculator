    <h1>Converter</h1>
    <p>Write functions to be used by a cooking app that convert between units.
    <br>For example, a function that converts gallons to liters. </p>
    <p>Create a project for this like you did for the calculator, so that you can
       return and build a front-end for this later.</p>
